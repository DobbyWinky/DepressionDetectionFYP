# DepressionDetectionFYP
Final year project

This project contains the code which was done as part of my Final year thesis project in 2019. It uses RSDD dataset and predicts if the user is depressed or not based on the linguistic metadata that the user uses in his posts. We targetted sub-reddits such as r/depression and so on.

Future work:
1. Enhance the project to provide help if the ML model predicts if the user is depressed.
